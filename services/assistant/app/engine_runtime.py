"""
Runtime DecisionEngine class that mirrors the class used in the notebook
so that unpickling a model saved from a notebook (module "__main__") can
be safely mapped to this module.

NOTE: Unpickling does not call __init__; attributes are restored from the
pickle. We keep a compatible signature and attributes to match the pickled
object shape.
